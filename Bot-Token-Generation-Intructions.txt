New implementations of this discord bot will require the user to generate a new Discord Bot Token. 

First, go to https://discord.com/developers to enter the Developer Portal. 
- On the page named "Applications", click the button in the upper right corner labelled "New Application".
- Give it a name (must be unique to any other Application names you have created) and click "Create".

You will now have access to customization and information features about your application. 

Now that an application has been made, you need to make a Bot for interaction with Discord
- On the left hand side there is a menu with option "Bot" click on that. 
- Click on the button "Add Bot" and then confirm that you want to add a bot to this application

Next you need to authorize the application to act as a Bot.
- On the left hand side there is a menu with option "OAuth2", click on that.
- You must select at least one of the scopes, for this application, check the box that says "bot" in the second column
- Copy the link that this generates and paste it into the web browser of your choice.
- You will be given a page with a dropdown menu of possible Discord Servers to authorize the bot on
- Select the server you want the Bot to operate on (you must have the permission "Manage Server" to add Bots)
- Click "Authorize" and complete the recaptcha

Finally, you need to generate the Bot Token
- Under the subheading "Token" near the top of the page there is a piece of text that says "Click to Reveal Token"
- Either reveal and copy token or click on the "Copy" button underneath
- *THIS TOKEN SHOULD NOT BE SHARED WITH OTHERS*
- You now have the Bot Token and can use it to start your bot, instructions to start the bot will be in another tutorial.
