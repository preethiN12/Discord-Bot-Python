# Discord Game Bot

This bot will serve as a TA led, but student built initiative. I have currently only added placeholder.

Currently, the program can be run by prefixing your bot token. If you normally run python as `python3 main.py`, run is as `BOT_TOKEN=j8sk3...378 BOT_CHAN=757377962772267108 python3 main.py`
Obtain the channel from a testing channel in the pins. Obtain your own token for this course.

Any modules installed should be places into requirements.txt. This is used in the build process.
